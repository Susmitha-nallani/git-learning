This is the example for git learning.

1>Git init --> for initialize the git repository.


2>Working Repository===>((Git status)):For show the status of the git branch status.

===Before no file present in the project showing status like this 
C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\GitLe>git status
On branch master
No commits yet
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

====>for example to create the empty file like(.txt) in the project show like this 

C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\GitLe>git status
On branch master
No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        example.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

3> Staging Repository((git add)) ===>In Working Repository to statging we can sending 
single single files.But in local and remote we can't send single file.

but in this we can send single file also like example.txt.

Example===> 
C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\GitLe>git add code.py
C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\GitLe>git status
On branch master
No commits yet
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   code.py

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        example.txt


===> Now we can see that no code.py showing in the tracking directory.


4>Local Repository((Git Commit)) ===> For sending the  files in local we can use commit Command.
We are not single file commit,But we can commit specific area files we can commit
in local repostory.
Examples====>I have  example.txt and code.py  files.
 I cannot commit only single  like (code .py)
 
Example ===> C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\GitLe>git commit -m  "Commiting code and examplefiles"
[master (root-commit) 5167091] Commiting code and examplefiles
 2 files changed, 59 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 code.py
 create mode 100644 example.txt

5> Remote Repository((Git Push)) ===> For sending the file or files in remote we can use Push Command.

We are just adding remote origin from local to remote ,Use below command.
(first you need to create onre repository in the github,And after creating the repository showing origin likebelow command)

C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\GitLe>git remote add origin https://github.com/Susmitha-nallani/git-learning.git


****After you sending the data in the origin repository we can push overall data in the git push to remote.

Example====> 

C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\GitLe>git push -u origin master  (****here master is the Branch name)

To https://github.com/Susmitha-nallani/git-learning.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
branch 'master' set up to track 'origin/master'.


======> After Pushing the data WE CAN REFRESH THE PAGE IN TH GIT HUB SHOW THAT FILES SHOWING OR NOT IN THE GIT.




FOR  CREATING BRANCHES 
=====================

We can use command for creating branches (-b for creating new branch if you dont give -b you can jump another branch)
===> git checkout for jumping the Branches.(In this case we cannot give -b)
===> git checkout -b "uou can give here branch name"


Example==== > git checkout -b "copy1"

C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\GitLe>git checkout -b "copy1"
Switched to a new branch 'copy1'


=====> Here we can see how many branches are presentusing git branch command.


Example===>  git branch

C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\GitLe>git branch
* copy1
  master
